## Project Overview: 

In this project, we will leverage Machine Learning technology. We will train various models to predict with accuracy if an individual earns >$50,000.00 or <$50,000.00 annually. The [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) is from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository. This information is available to be used by the “machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms”. 

Our group specifically used Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The outputs of the various models will be displayed on a website, along with the corresponding analysis. 

The project repository is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/NoahLeVoir/income_prediction).
