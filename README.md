## 📊 Project Overview: 

In this project, we leveraged Machine Learning. We trained various models to predict if an individual earns >$50,000.00 or <$50,000.00 annually. The [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) is from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository. This information is available to the “machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms”. 

Our group specifically deployed Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Neural Network models. The outputs of the models are displayed on our [website](https://umn-ml-incomepredction.herokuapp.com/), along with the corresponding analysis. 

## 💻 Programs & Languages:

To complete this project, our team used a variety of programs and languages. This includes Jupyter Notebook, HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. Additionally, Scikit-learn, Bootstrap, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Seaborn were leveraged in the completion of this project. To host our analysis online, Heroku was utilized.
